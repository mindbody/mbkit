# Toaster Usage

## Basic Usage

The consuming application will be responsible for the showing and hiding of the toaster using the "show" prop.

You should see the Toaster example at the bottom of your screen.

```tsx
<Toaster show={true}>Here's a Toaster example</Toaster>
```

Click the button below to see the Toaster show up on screen for 5 seconds. 

<RenderOnly>
    <ToasterExample message="Here's a five second Toaster demo" />
</RenderOnly>

Click the button below to see the Toaster show up on top of the screen for 5 seconds.
